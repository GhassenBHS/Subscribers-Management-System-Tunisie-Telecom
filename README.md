# Subscribers-Management-System-Tunisie-Telecom

The objective of this internship was the automation of the management of the company's subscribers via a web app and a local database. Database of subscribers couldn't be added of course. 

The work contains PHP scripts that allows every category of users (IPMSAN and DLU) to be managed (add, modify, remove, consult)

It is considered a hakish code but it did the job for them.
